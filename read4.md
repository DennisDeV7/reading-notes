# Structure web pages with HTML

## Wireframe and Design

  Wireframe is a website planning practice which determines an information hierarchy

  You can make a wireframe with the following two methods:
    1. Paper: or just hand drawn on anything, this can help with making easy changes early on
    2. Software: such as Invision, UXPin, or Wireframe.cc

  The six steps to make a wireframe
    1. Research
    2. Consolidate reasearch to quick references
    3. Map the user flow
    4. Draft and Sketch
      -Don't draw or illustrate
    5. Add detail and test
    6. Turn wireframe into prototype

  Key principles:
    1. Clarity
    2. Confidence
    3. Simplicity

## HTML

  HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your project.

  HTML main parts of an element:
    1. The opening tag
    2. The closing tag
    3. The content

  Elements have attributes which contain extra information about the element that does not appear in the project and can be nested. 

  Structure of HTML document
    -`<!DOCTYPE html>` needed to run correctly
    -`<html>` the root element
    -`<head>` acts as the container
    -`<meta charset="utf-8">` sets the characters in the document
    -`<title>` makes a title
    -`<body>` the content

  Adding an image:
    -`<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">`

  HTML tags
    -`<h1>My main title</h1>`
    -`<h2>My top level heading</h2>`
    -`<h3>My subheading</h3>`
    -`<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>`
    -`<p>Paragraph</p>`
    -`<ul></ul>` unordered list
    -`<ol></ol>` ordered list
    -`<li></li>` list item

  Adding a link
    -`<a href="URL HERE">Mozilla Manifestor</a>`

## Semantics

  Semantics refers to the meaning of written code. Many of the tags listed above are considered semantic elements because they give their inner content meaning
