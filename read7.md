# Programming with JavaScript

## Control Flow

Control flow is the order the computer executes code in a program. It flows from the first line to the last line until it comes across a structure that changes the flow such as conditions and loops. 

## Functions

A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is noted by a `function` keyword followed by a name and a parentheses `()`. The parentheses can contain specific parameters. The function is followed by curly brackets which contain the code to be executed. Functions are useful because you can call it many times by just the function name without repeatedly writing the code within it over and over.

### Function Invocation

A function will start executing when it is "invoked" or called. This can be through user input (like clicking a button), other code, or self invoked.

### Function Return

A return statement will terminate or stop the execution of a function and return a value to the variable that called the function.

- `**`: Exponentiation
- `/` : Division
- `%` : Modulus
- `++`: Increment

## JavaScript Assignment Operators

- `=` | `x=y` | `x=y`
- `+=` | `x+=y` | `x=x+y`
