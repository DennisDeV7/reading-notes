# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?\
Functional Programming is building a computer program that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?\
A pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?\
A pure function has no observable side effects
4. What is immutability?\
Immutability is when the state of data cannot change after it's created.
5. What is Referential transparency?\
Referential transparency is when a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

## Node JS

1. What is a module?\
A module is just another javascript file. 
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?\
Require pulls in another javaScript file.
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?\
We can bring in another module by using `require('./file')`
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?\
Another Module can be brought into the current file by using module.export and then making the variable the same in the current file
