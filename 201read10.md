## JS Chapter 10 Error Handling and Debugging

JavaScript stacks processes one line of code at a time. 

There are many different types of errors:

- SyntaxError
- ReferenceError
- EvalError
- URIError
- TypeError
- RangeError
- Error
- NaN

Dealing with errors

1. Debug the script
2. Handle errors gracefully: use try, catch, throw, and finally statements to handle potential errors from users or servers

```js
try{
  // execute code 
} catch (exception) {
  // code if there is an exception
} finally {
  // this always gets executed
}
```

Create your own error message:

`throw new Error('message');`
