# Reading 1 Notes

## Introduction

The book, "HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites" by Jon Duckett covers how to structure a website with HTML and how to style it with CSS. He gives a brief description on how people access a website. The website is first requested by the user in a web browser. The web browser then submits a request to a web server which is hosting the desired website.  

## Chapter 1: Structure

The generic structure of an HTML document is the head, title, and body. These elements can nest other elements to add more structure and detail such as headers, paragraphs, images, links, and many more. An element is called in HTML using tags. Tags are characters enclosed in angled brackets in order to declare the opening and closing of an element. Attributes can be added to an element in order to add more detail and function to it. Attributes typically have a name and a value which is inside double quotes.

## Chapter 8: Extra Markup

In HTML it is useful to know additional topics to add functionality to the website. For example, the Doctype tag declares which version of HTML the web page will be using. Others include adding comments for a developer to see but not a user by `<!-- -->`, or inline elements which enable the developer to alter text mid paragraph. You can also include an inline window of another website through the `<iframe>` tag. Finally there are a list of characters called escape characters which enable the user to add characters to thier website that would otherwise be seen as native HTML code such as brackets.

## Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout

HTML5 is the newest version of HTML and is still in production. This includes new features and it is important to add elements to the website that will enable users with older web browsers to still view a website written in HTML5. In summary HTML5 will make for clearer code and help improve the devlopment process.

## Chapter 18: Process & Design

When creating a website it is important to design it so it looks attractive, it gives the users what they are looking for, and it can be easily navigated. This can be done by knowing the target audience and asking yourself questions about what they would want when visiting your site. Quick layouts and designs of a website can be seen by creating wireframes and site maps which display basic shapes and positions of content to make it clear what you are coding towards.

## JS Introduction

The book "JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY Interactive Front-End Web Development" by Jon Duckett covers how to make a website interactive and full of features with JavaScript. He also teaches how to code in JavaScript more efficiently with jQuery.

## JS Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming

One of the first things you need to know about programming is what a script is and how to write one. A script is a series of commands that the computer will follow in order to achieve the desired outcome. You can make a script by breaking up the entire operation into small tasks and then coding each individual task. A flowchart can be used to help break down the steps of the program. A computer sees the world around it through data driven models. These models can be broken down to objects, properties, events, and methods. It is a good practice to keep each of the languages in their own text file. JavaScript is written in its own .js file, HTML written in its own file, and CSS written in its own file.
