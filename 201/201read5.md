### Text

When selecting a typeface it is important to know that the browser will only display it if it's installed on the computer. It is declared with properties like:

- font family: Times;
- font-size: 20px;

The point scale, commonly used in the document editors like Microsoft Word to make the size of font, is based off of 1 point being 1/72 of an inch.

### Blog Post: JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

- JPEG: (Joint Photographic Experts Group)for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in color and intensity is smooth.
- PNG: (Portable Graphics Format) Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.
- GIF: (Graphics Interchange Format) for images that contain animations.
