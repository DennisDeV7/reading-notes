## Chapter 15: Layout

### Positioning Elements

- Normal Flow: each block level element appears on a new line
- Relative Positioning: pushes the element in a direction relative to its position in normal flow
- Absolute Positioning: element is taken out of normal flow and will move as the user scrolls through page
- Fixed Positioning: positions element relative to the browser window as opposed to the containing element
- FLoating Positioning: allows you to place an element to the left or right of a containing box

### Screen Size vs. Design

Screen sizes can range from small phones to large desktop monitors. It's important that the website design can accomodate the size of any screen.

### Fixed width and liquid Layouts

- Fixed Layout: hint is in the name, layout is fixed and tends to be designated with pixels
- Liquid Layout: can change based on the size of the browser window, typically designated with percentages.

### Using grids

A grid can help a designer position content on a page. This also helps with adding or replacing content very consistantly.
