# Read 6 Notes

## The Problem Domain

You can learn and teach software development by making the problem domain easier. It is also beneficial to understand the problem better. Don't skip on steps that can help you better understand the problem.

## Primitive Values and Object References in JS

A primitve value is directly set to a variable. A Object reference is a variable which stores the reference to a value. Primitive values are also immutable, or can't be changed. Object references are mutable and can be changed.

## Chapter 3: Object Literals

An object groups together a set of variables and functions to create a model.

```js
var hotel = {
  name: 'Quay',
  rooms: 40,
  booked: 25,
  checkAvailability: function(){
    return this.rooms - this.booked;
  }
}
```

In the above example, checkAvailability is a method of hotel. A method is a function of an object. Whereas name, rooms, and booked are properties of hotel. An object can be called by using the dot notation:
`hotel.name;`

## Chapter 5: Document Object Model

Document Object Model(DOM) is a separate set of rules implemented by the browser that specifies how the browser should create an html page and how JavaScript will access it.

A method that finds elements within the DOM tree are called DOM queies.

You can select individual elements by the following format

`object.method('parameter')`
