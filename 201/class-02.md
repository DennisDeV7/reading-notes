# Read 2 Notes

## Chapter 2: Text

To add additional meaning to text in an HTML file you can use structural and semantic markup. Structural markup are tags that add structure to the web page such as headings (`<h1>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and breaks (`<br />`) to name a few and are typically indented. Semantic markup are tags that add information to the web page but do not affect the structure of it. Some examples of semantic elements are: `<strong>`, `<blockquote>`, and `<cite>` just to name a few.

## Chapter 10: Introducing CSS

CSS is a language that creates rules for a webpage and alters its appearance. A style rule can be broken down into two main parts: a selector and a declaration. The selector identifies which element the rule is applied to. The declaration indicates how the selected element or elements will by styled. A declaration can be broken down further into two more elements: a property, and a value. A property declares the aspect of the element that you want to change such as the font, color, thickness, etc. The value specifies the property that you choose. For example if you choose color, the value could be blue. CSS can be used inline, which means that it is directly added to a tag of an html element, or it can be used as a separate document. Having it as a separate document is the preferred method because it can then be applied to multiple HTML pages.

## JS Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

A script is a series of instructions that JavaScript gives the web browser. Each individual script is called a statement. It may be necessary at times to declare variables. A variable allows you to assign a value to a keyword. A variable consists of a keyword, a name, an assignment operator, and the value. An array is a variable that can store more than one value.

## JS Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

Flowcharts can be used to help map the decisions that the JavaScript program has to make. A decision can be broken into two parts: an evaluated expression, and a conditional statement. An example conditional statement could be in the form of an if statement: if a condition is met, then the code is executed.

### Comparison operators

- `===`: Strict equal to
- `!==`: Strict not equal to
- `==`: is equal to
- `!=`: is not equal to
- `<`: less than
- `>`: greater than
- `<=`: less than or equal to
- `=>`: greater than or equal to

### Three types of loops

1. for: loops through items in a list or array.
2. while: continues to run a block of code while a condition is true.
3. do...while: similar to while loop but will run the block of code at least once even if the condition is false.
