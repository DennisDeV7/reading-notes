# Read 7 Notes

## Domain Modeling
<!-- https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling -->
Domain Modeling is creating a software based conceptual model of a problem. Software that stores data in properties and holds behaviors in methods is also referred to as object-oriented modeling.

Object oriented programming in JavaScript can be summarized in three steps

1. The`new` keyword created an object
2. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the `this` variable
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use

## Chapter 6 Tables

A table represents information in a grid format. The basic structure of tables includes:

- `<table>`: creates the table
- `<tr>`: the start of each row
- `<td>`: each cell of a table

## Chapter 3 Functions, Methods, and Objects

- Object constructor notation:

```js
   var hotel = new Object();
   hotel.name = 'Quay';
   hotel.rooms = 40;
   hotel.booked = 25;
   hotel.checkAvailability = function(){
     return this.rooms - this.booked;
   };
```

### Three Groups of Built in Objects

1. Browser Object Model: Creates model of the browser tab or window.
2. Document Object Model: Creates a model of the current web page.
3. Global JavaScript Objects: Groups of individial objects that relate to different parts of the JS language
