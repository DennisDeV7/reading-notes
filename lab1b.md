# Growth mindset

  Growth mindset is believing that there is constant improvement through hard work and effort. In addition,
  it is maintaining positivity and perserverance so failures are not seen as a hinderance but an opportunity.
  I keep myself in the growth mindset in the following three ways:
  
 1. Get inspired by others who maintain a growth mindset whether its family, a celebrity, or mentor.
 2. I keep a personal written account of goals and daily activities and record how i did or did not act in accordance with a growth mindset.
 3. Hard work: persisting through daunting tasks enables you to take on progresssively harder tasks. They don't even have to be relevant to your career in order to help. The following are some examples of difficult tasks that will encourage a growth mindset.
    - Waking up early
    - Intense exercise
