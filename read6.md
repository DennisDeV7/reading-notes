# Dynamic Web with JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is an object oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive. JS borrows most of its syntax from other languages such as Java, C, and C++.

## Comments

Comments are made the same way as C++

`// is a one line comment`

  `/* This is,`

  `* a multi-line`

  `*/ comment`

## Declarations

 JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations

 1. var: Declares a variable, the value may change
 2. let: Declares a block-scoped, local variable, older browsers, can give unexpected behavior
 3. const: Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant

## Data Types

 1. Boolean: true and false
 2. Null: denotes a null value
 3. Undefined: property whose value is not defined
 4. Number: integer or floating point
 5. BigInt: integer with arbitrary precision
 6. String: Sequence of characters that represent a text value
 7. Symbol: data type whose instances are unique and immutable
