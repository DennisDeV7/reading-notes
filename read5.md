# Design with CSS

Cascading Style Sheet or CSS enables a creator to enhance how documents are presented. This can include but not limit to the color, size, and position of the HTML elements.

The appearance of a website can be controlled by one external style sheet written in CSS. The HTML code must include references to the external sheet. This file cannot contain HTML tags within it.

The styling can also be added internally within an HTML file using style elements such as the ones mentioned above. This will add the style specifically to the HTML page not to the entire website.

Inline styling can add style specifically to a single element by placing the style tag within the HTML element.

If more than one style is mentioned in the HTML file, they will cascade in the following priority order:

1. Inline style
2. External and internal style sheets
3. Browser default

## Color

The color function does as it sounds and changes the color of the webpage. It uses the following syntax:

color: color|initial|inherit;

- color: specifies text color
- initial: sets the property to default
- inherit: inherits this property from its parent element
