# My Reading Notes

## About Me
My name is Dennis DeVries
  I separated from the US Army after serving for four years in various places such as Alaska, Kuwait, and Iraq to name a few. Previously, i studied Mechanical Engineering at Clarkson University and recieved my Bachelors degree. I am now pursuing a fresh qualification in software development at Code Fellows in order to confidently enter the technology field. 

Growth mindset:

  Growth mindset is believing that there is constant improvement through hard work and effort. In addition,
  it is maintaining positivity and perserverance so failures are not seen as a hinderance but an opportunity.
  I keep myself in the growth mindset in the following three ways:
  
 1. Get inspired by others who maintain a growth mindset whether its family, a celebrity, or mentor.
 2. I keep a personal written account of goals and daily activities and record how i did or did not act in accordance with a growth mindset.
 3. Hard work: persisting through daunting tasks enables you to take on progresssively harder tasks. They don't even have to be relevant to your career in order to help. The following are some examples of difficult tasks that will encourage a growth mindset.
    - Waking up early
    - Intense exercise
    - Reading

# Text Editors vs IDE's

## Text Editor
  A text editor is software that you can download which enables you to write and configure text. 
  Text editors can come with helpful features that help you create faster. Below is a list of just a few of these helpful features
  1. Code completion: a type of predictive text feature that displays options to insert based on the context of your writing
  2. Syntax highlighting: if certain text you write has specific attributes, the editor will automatically change the color consistent with others of the same attribute
  3. Themes: simply the ability to view the code/text to make the screen more enjoyable to look at or possibly reduce strain on the eyes. 
  
  Text editors can range from software with hardly any features to pieces that are rich with features. Every computer comes with some form of a text editor such as
  notepad, or gedit and these tend to have more simple features. There are third party text editors that range from being free to costing money and have many features in addition to the ones noted above.
 
 ## IDE's
  An IDE, or Integrated Development Enviornment, is a mixture of different software coming together in one program in order to offer all of the features you could
  need in one place. When it comes to writing code an IDE can edit text, manage files, compile your code, and debug in one place. There can be so many features in an
  IDE that it can be confusing for a beginner. In this instance sticking to a text editor is a good option.
