# My Reading Notes

## About Me
My name is Dennis DeVries

Growth mindset:

  Growth mindset is believing that there is constant improvement through hard work and effort. In addition,
  it is maintaining positivity and perserverance so failures are not seen as a hinderance but an opportunity.
  I keep myself in the growth mindset in the following three ways:
  
 1. Get inspired by others who maintain a growth mindset whether its family, a celebrity, or mentor.
 2. I keep a personal written account of goals and daily activities and record how i did or did not act in accordance with a growth mindset.
 3. Hard work: persisting through daunting tasks enables you to take on progresssively harder tasks
