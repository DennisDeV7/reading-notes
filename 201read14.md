## The Perfect Team
<!-- https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html -->

the story of Julia Rozovsky is very intersesting about her direct experience with two different groups. One of them a very positive, collaborative experience. The other, not so much. This article strikes close to home because i too wondered about this having to work with many large and small teams in my short career in the military.

### Google's Study: Project Aristotle

- Good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical
- Rozovsky joins the team
- after gathering large amounts of data on how their teams operate they couldn't draw a conclusion
- They discovered that the "norms" of the group were one of the most important parts and could collectively increase or decrease the collective intelligence level
- Two behaviors good teams shared:
      - "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking"
      - had high average social sensitivity
- "shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking"
- psychological safety seems to be the most important factor: how to build this?
- to answer the question above: a start is with emotional conversations
- people need to feel free and share things that scare them without fear

## Things I want to learn more about

I am very passionate about this topic and study related topics casually on the side. A next step in this study in my opinion is: how can individuals practice and train or cultivate themselves to be more intune with their own emotions and how it affects others and how to be intune with the emotions of others? Some people I have noticed, in my experience, have more intuition in this regard than others.
