## Local Storage
<!-- Source: diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html -->

The main goal with local storage opposed to using cookies with web applications is the following:

- A lot of storage space
- On the client
- The data persists beyond a page refresh
- The data isn't transmitted to a server

HTML5 "local storage" is a way for web pages to store key/value pairs locally, within the client browser.

The data is not transmitted to a server like cookies are. It stores the information locally on the machine in the web browser.

Using JavaScript you can access the local storage through the localStorage object.

## Things I want to know more about

Does this search for storage space first? or can you overfill a local disk if you are not careful?
