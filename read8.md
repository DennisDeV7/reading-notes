# Operators and Loops

An operator in JavaScript is a symbol that performs an operation on a value or variable. There are many different types of operators such as:

## Assignment operators

An assignment operator assigns the value to the left of the operand based on the value of its right operand. For example: `x = f()`

## Comparison operator

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.
