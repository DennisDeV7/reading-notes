## Data types in JavaScript

- a way of labeling and organizing data
- a way to format our data so our program can use it properly

JavaScript is a **loosely typed** and **dynamic** language

- that we don't have to know the type of data to declare a variable
- variables do not need to be declared with a type

`let dog;`

- dynamic - I can change the type of data after the variable has been declared

`dog = 'woof'`

## Types

### Strings

- a sequence of characters used to represent text. Written with single quotes.
  - `hello`
  - `dlfjadklfjal`

### Number

- numeric data type
  - full numbers, negatives, decimals

### Booleans

- Logical operators
  - `true`
  - `false`

### Undefined

- it has not been defined yet
  - `let dog;`

### Null

- something that has been defined as none
  - `let dog = null;`
