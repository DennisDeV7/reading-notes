- Node: component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes
- Root: node at the beginning of the tree
- K: the maximum number of children any node may have
- Left: A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right: A reference to the other child, in a bnary tree
- Edge: The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf: A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height: The number of edges from the root of the furthest leaf
- Depth Traversal: prioritizing traversing throught the depth or height of the tree first
- Breadth Traversal: iterating throught the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node

## Things I want to know more about

What are the use cases for trees all of these related topics?
