# The Growth Mindset

## Deliberate practice

It is very easy to get caught in the rat race and to keep working day to day without the intention of constant improvement. This is a very important factor in improving not just at software development but in every day life tasks and events. Some key areas of deliberate practice are the following:

- The activity goes beyond your usual comfort level
- Repetition
- Continuous feedback
- It's highly demanding
- It's difficult
- Goal oriented

## Grit

I read Angela Duckworth's book, "Grit" recently and have a few notes relative to the growth mindset and of course, grit.

- It is important for parents, teachers, leaders to encourage the growth mindset by encouraging your children, students, and subordiantes to see things through and to not quit. 
- There are three stages to being an expert at something:
      1. Develop an interest in something
      2. Develop skills in that topic
      3. Incorporate it into the lives of others
- Many feel that a career should be tied to a sense of purpose. She found that for most people that sense of purpose usually is revolving around the improvment of other people - serving a purpose greater than yourself.

## Emotional Intelligence results

After taking the quick emotional intelligence quiz I found that I scored higher in the awareness categories over the management categories. This makes sense to me I think I could improve by more group work and being involved with other people.
