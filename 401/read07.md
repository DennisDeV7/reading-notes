## Python Scope

Global\
When you run a Python program you are in the global scope. When running in the global scope python turns your main script into a module, __main__.

- dir(): command to view all of the names that exist in the global scope

It is considered bad practice to modify global names

Python offers keywords to help modify global and nonlocal names

- global
- nonlocal

A nonlocal statement allows you to modify a name in an inner function

## Big O

Big O is a way of comparing algorithm performance and space requiremnets.

Its best to determine the Big O based on the worst cased scenario

Types:

- O(1): constant
- O(logn): logarithmic
- O(n): linear
- O(nlogn): log-linear
- O(n^k): polynomial
