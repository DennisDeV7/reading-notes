# Django Models

## Using Models

Models are Python objects that manage data in a Django application.

Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file.

example model

```py
from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    # â€¦

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the URL to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name
```

A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, which represent a column of data.

You can start this by registering your desired models and creating a superuser
