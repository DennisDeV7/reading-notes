# Web Scraping

Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amount of data from a website.

Important notes about web scraping:

1. Read through the websiteâ€™s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
2. Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.

The steps are:

1. Inspect the website
2. Grab relevent files/ html elements
3. import relevant libraries (requests, urllib.request, time, bs4)
4. set url
5. parse html with beautiful soup
6. find all <a> tags
7. extract link
8. pause code to slow it down
