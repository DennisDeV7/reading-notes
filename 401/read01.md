## Pain vs. Suffering

The course can certainly have its pains spending all of these hours late into the night or early into the morning depending how you look at it. It can be quite painful in various ways but it is important to keep your goals in mind and to keep pushing through

## Big O Notation

Big O is a term that is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, aimed specifically towards the worst case scenario. There are different types:

- O(1): algorithm that always executes in the same time regardless of the size
- O(N): an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
- O(NÂ²): algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set
- O(2^N): an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set
- O(logN): algorithm that calculates with logarithmic relationship

## A Friendly intro to Big O Notation

A way of evaluating how efficient something is. How well does this algorithm or data structure perform. How much time does it need? How much memory does it need? Best perforance is called Constant time. Meaning if the grade is constant no matter how complex the input is BigO(1).

## Names and Values in Python

Why test your code?

- The best way we know if code works.
- It saves time
- It results in better code
- It removes fear
- Debugging is hard, testing is easy"

Testing code is also repeatable so you can constantly run and test your code without manually entering values

Signs of good tests:

- Automated
- Fast
- Reliable
- Informative
- Focused

### Unittest

- Python standard Library
- Infrastructure for well-structured tests
- Patterned on xUnit

Test Isolation

- Every test gets a new test object
- Tests can't affect each other
- Failure doesn't stop next tests
