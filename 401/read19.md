## Regular Expressions 

There are many functions and expressions for more see [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-regular-expression-tutorial)

In order to use regular expressions you must first `import re`

Useful funtions that come with re

- compile()
- search()
- findall()
- sub()
- split()

A period matches any single character except the newline character

`^` matches a phrase that starts with a certain character

`$` matches the ends of a string

`[a-zA-Z0-9]` matches all lower case letters, upper case letters, and numbers 0-9
