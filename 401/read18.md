# Cryptography

## Encryption, Decryption & Cracking

Encryption, in the article, is a shift in letters, numbers, or symbols to make secure communication

Decryption is translating the encrypted data into the message

Cracking is figuring out the cipher which encrypts the message. There are three main techniques for cracking

1. Frequency analysis
2. Known plaintext
3. Brute force

## Caesar Cipher

Caesar's cipher is known as the shift cipher. It was very simple, but affective for their time. It was creating a shift and then replacing the letter in plaintext with a letter that was further in the alphabet according to the shift.

Cryptography is more important now than ever with a larger presence on the internet the greater the need for your communications, documents, and data to be encrypted.
