## Chart.js

Chart.js is a third party plugin that makes adding charts to your javaScript files easy.

1. First you have to download Chart.js
2. Create a canvas element in your HTML file so Chart.js can create the chart
3. Create the chart in JavaScript

### Drawing with Canvas

Canvas uses a coordinate system to enable the developer to create items and place it in the canvas. Some examples:

- `fillRect(x, y, width, height)` draws a filled rectangle
- `strokeRect(x, y, width, height)` draws a rectangular outline
- `clearRect(x, y, width, height)` clears an area making it transparent

Add colors to these properties with `fillstyle` and `color` in javaScript
